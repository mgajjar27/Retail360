Why Pivot Tables Were Used:
In the Retail360, pivot tables were extensively used to efficiently summarize and analyze the data. By using pivot tables, I was able to create dynamic and detailed charts that provide a comprehensive overview of key metrics like sales, returns, and profits.
Summarizing Data: Pivot tables helped me quickly organize and summarize large amounts of data. I could easily find the total sales for each product category or see which payment method was used the most, without having to manually calculate or sort through the data.
Flexible and Efficient: Pivot tables allowed me to filter and view the data in different ways. I could switch between sales by month, product category, or payment method with just a few clicks, making it easier to explore the data.
Automatic Calculations: The pivot tables automatically calculated important numbers like total sales, profit, and return rates. This saved time and reduced errors, as I didn’t have to do any calculations manually. Plus, whenever the data was updated, the tables and charts updated automatically.
Multiple Data Views: Pivot tables made it simple to look at the data from different angles. For example, I could see monthly sales, returns by product, or profits by payment method, helping me find patterns and insights easily.
